The allure of entrepreneurship has never been greater. Startups are one of the very few ways to make it (really) big in life. There's a LOT of content on the whys and hows of starting your venture. Almost everyone seems to have a vision for the next big thing - a product or service that will change the world.

Hence, it becomes more important than ever to acknowledge the reality of the startup landscape. 
   According to the latest data, up to 90% of startups fail. Across almost all industries, the average failure rate for year one is 10%. However, in years two through five, a staggering 70% of new businesses will fail.

This is an opinionated decision making system that tries to help evaluate startup ideas, and help you decide if you should launch that startup(or pivot, respectively). It tries to bring in objective elements that I've gathered through a lot of reading on this topic into the process of evaluating startup ideas.
